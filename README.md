This project solves the problem CV-1-26. The program reads a synthetic image of a circle, that is, a single perfect circle against a background (the background and circle are of different colors). When running the program, the user enters the full path to the file and the file itself (if the file is in the same directory as the executable program, then just the file name). The program outputs the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe circle in pixels and saves a binary mask of the image in the executable file directory in the format "file_name + _," where the circle itself is white and the background is black. The program itself reads the file and creates a binary mask. Then, it calculates the "roundness" of the two resulting objects using the formula 4ùùÖ * S(object) / P(object) ^ 2.The object with the higher value is considered a circle, its pixels are turned white (if the program previously made them black), and its area is calculated.
